Hello, this is a simple Tic Tac Toe app written in Python.

Its a multi-player game and doesn't require any prior installations or downloads.

It should run perfectly on your editor or command line.

All the code is adequately commented, that way, you'll understand what exactly am doing in each line.

Thank you and happy Tic-tac-toeing :)
